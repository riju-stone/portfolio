# Portfolio

Made with `React`, `Styled Components` and `Framer-Motion`

## Credits

I am not great at UI/UX design. I am still learning so much about web development and UI/UX every single day and I am, in no way, the sole developer of this project; rather, this is an accumulation of inspirations and tremendeous help from some notable people and sources along with ideas and implementation of my own...

- The Hamburger Menu and a few other things were inspired from designs by [Akram Khalid](https://wrongakram.com/)
- All the stock background videos were created and rendered by [Rostislav Uzunov](https://www.pexels.com/@rostislav-uzunov-3145660)
- The various beautiful animations were created in RIVE editor by the RIVE community
- `StackOverflow` and `YouTube` - the sole saviour of all my problems.

## Attribution

I have made my portfolio open-source with the sole purpose that people might be willing to make their own using this project, either by directly modifying the code or by using it as an inspiration.

All I ask for is proper attribution to my work. That would mean a lot to me...
