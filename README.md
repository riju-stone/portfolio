# Portfolio

Made with `React`, `Styled Components` and `Framer-Motion`

## Credits

I am not great at UI/UX design. I am still learning so much about web development and UI/UX design and I am, in no way, the sole contributor to this project; rather, this is a collaboration of inspirations and tremendeous help from some notable people and sources along with a few twists and turns of my own...

- The Canvas Erasing, Hamburger Menu and a few other things were inspired from designs by [Akram Khalid](https://wrongakram.com/)
- All the videos were created and rendered by [Rostislav Uzunov](https://www.pexels.com/@rostislav-uzunov-3145660)
- `StackOverflow` and `YouTube` - the sole saviour of all my problems.

## Attribution

I have made my portfolio an open-source project with the sole purpose that people might be willing to make their own portfolio using this project, either directly or as an inspiration.

All I ask for is proper attribution to my work. That would mean a lot to me.
